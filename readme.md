## Repository Organisation

The organisation of the repository follows common conventions and therefore requires little explanation. Our analysis notebooks (with technical details) are subordinated to [`notebooks/`](./notebooks/)

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11.3
- pyenv

### Setup

1. Navigate to a working directory of your choice, then clone the repository and enter it:

   ``` shell
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git &&
       cd <reponame>
   ```

2. Choose a setup option based on your operating system and intended use:

   - `make basic-unix` / `make basic-win`: for general use or exploration (core dependencies only).
   - `make dev-unix` / `make dev-win`: for contributors (includes development tools like linters and pre-commit hooks).

   If you prefer to run the commands manually yourself or want to inspect what each `make` target does first, use the `-n` flag for a dry run. This prints the commands without executing them:

   ``` shell
   make -n <target>
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS/Linux, run:

     ```shell
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows (PowerShell), run:

     ``` powershell
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
